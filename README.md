## Commentary

This was a first game I made in Godot. Itâ€™s a great engine and already prefer it to Game Maker 2, which I used to use. However, I still had to learn many things during this Ludum Dare, which would now make me significantly more productive. 
I originally wanted to have branching dialogs, but I ended with such a mess of a spaghetti code, that I was unable to debug and fix it in a reasonable time, so I had to decide for one-side dialogs only. Maybe next time!
Known issues:
* Sometimes the dialog abruptly ends when you skip the last text of the dialog by pressing Space.

## Tools used.

If you want to open the game, you just need Godot 3.4.

* Sounds made with BFXR; 
* Voices made in FL Studio using VST Speek 3.

* Most of the visual assets were created in Inkscape, all of them are in .svg files.
* In some cases, Aseprite was used, projects are in their .ase files.
